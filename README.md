# Week 1 Review Project

## This is an UNGRADED pair programming assignment.  Please take the next 45 minutes to complete the following tasks in a directory called week1.project

1) Create a Class called SentenceParser that has the following properties:
  a) this.words: an array of words from a string passed into the constructor.
2) The class should have a method called write that writes this.words as a sentence string to a file located in a directory called data.
  a) This should use the node fs module.
3) A class method called replace that takes in two arguments: find and replace and searches the array of words and replaces it.
  a) This method should return a promise.
  b) The promise should resolve with the new words concatenated as a string.
  c) The promise shuold reject an error if no word is found.
4) This module should be executed by running a node terminal command and use a terminal command argument to save words to the senctenceParser instance.
You may use whatever directory structure you want, and you may any available resources to complete the requirements.
